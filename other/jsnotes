What is JavaScript (JS)?

JavaScript (JS) is a programming language used to build any type of web application. It was released in 1995.

In 1993, websites became very popular, and everyone started creating their own webpages. But at that time, the webpages were static — they only showed fixed content and did not respond to user actions. The websites were not interactive.

To make web pages interactive and keep users engaged, Netscape, along with Sun Microsystems, introduced JavaScript in 1995. It was released with the Netscape Navigator 2 browser and was mainly designed for web frontend development.

Initially, JavaScript was only used for building frontend (client-side) applications. But as it became popular, developers started using it everywhere — because JavaScript was simple, flexible, and had a huge community of developers.

Later, people thought: “If JavaScript is powerful on the frontend, can we also use it for the backend?”
This idea led to the creation of Node.js — a runtime environment that allows JavaScript to run on servers, desktops, and even mobile devices.

JavaScript runs using a JS Engine. Each browser has its own JS Engine — for example, Chrome uses the V8 Engine, and Firefox uses SpiderMonkey. With the help of these engines and Node.js, JavaScript can now run on any machine or operating system.

Oracle Corporation is the trademark owner of JavaScript.

Summary:

* Full Form: JavaScript
* Introduced By: Netscape & Sun Microsystems
* Year: 1995
* Initially Used For: Frontend (web browser)
* Now Used For: Frontend, Backend, Mobile, Desktop, AI, ML
* Owner: Oracle Corporation
* Runtime Environment: Node.js
* Purpose: To make web pages interactive and dynamic

Code 1: Hello World!

In the real world, we solve problems using virtual solutions — these solutions are created through programming languages.

Machines do not understand human (high-level) languages; they only understand binary language (0s and 1s).
In every programming language, we need a compiler or an interpreter to convert high-level code into machine-understandable code.

In JavaScript, we have a **JS Engine** that performs this conversion — it converts JavaScript code into machine code.

We can write JavaScript code in any text editor or IDE, for example: Notepad, VS Code, Sublime, or Atom.

Example Code:

```javascript
console.log("Hello World");
```

**Note:**
Every browser has its own built-in JS Engine.
You can open the browser’s **Developer Tools → Console tab** to run JavaScript code directly.

If you want to run JavaScript code from the **Command Prompt (CMD)**, you must install **Node.js** on your system.
Then, run your file using the command:

```
node filename.js
```

Installations:

1. **VS Code (LTS version)**

   * Download and install Visual Studio Code (LTS version) from the official website.
   * It is a lightweight and powerful code editor for writing JavaScript and other programming languages.

2. **Node.js**

   * Download Node.js from the official website.
   * During installation, **accept the agreement** and click **Next** until the setup completes.
   * Node.js allows you to run JavaScript code **outside the browser** using the **command prompt (CMD)** or **terminal**.

---

**Node.js Verification:**
After installation, open **Command Prompt** or **VS Code Terminal** and type:

```
node --version
```



**Running JavaScript Code in VS Code:**

* You can run JavaScript files using the **terminal** in VS Code:

  ```
  node filename.js
  ```
* Or, you can install the **Code Runner Extension** from VS Code Marketplace.
  Once installed, you can directly **click the Run button** (▶️) at the top-right corner of the editor to execute your JavaScript code easily.


Variable in JavaScript

In the real world, everything is data. In programming, we need to store and process that data. Before processing and after processing the data, we store it temporarily in variables.

In JavaScript, we use the keyword "let" to declare a variable.

Example:
let user = "Susruthi"

Here, "user" is a variable that holds the value "Susruthi".
A variable means its value can change during program execution.

Example:
let age = 20
age = 21  // value changed

You don’t need to declare "let" again for the same variable when updating its value.

Rules for naming variables:

1. Variable names can contain letters, numbers, $ (dollar sign), and _ (underscore).
2. They must start with a letter, $ or _.
3. No spaces are allowed in variable names.
4. Variable names should be meaningful and logical.
5. Use camelCase or snake_case for better readability.

Examples:
Correct:
let userName
let total_amount
let $price
let _count

Incorrect:
let 1user      // cannot start with a number
let user name  // cannot contain spaces

const pi = 3.14
the varible in future i dont want to change the value then you can use const keyword.

Datatypes in JavaScript

In JavaScript, we can define datatypes in two ways:

1. Primitive Data Types – number, string, boolean, undefined, symbol
2. Object Data Types – arrays, objects, functions, etc.

Example of Primitive Data Types:
let num = 8.5
let num1 = 0xff  (hexadecimal)
let num2 = 1.5e12  (exponential notation)
num = 100_00_000  (numeric separator for readability)
let num3 = 5 / 0  (Infinity)

To represent very large numbers, we use BigInt by adding 'n' at the end of the number.
Example:
let num1 = 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000n

Concatenation in JavaScript:
The '+' symbol is used to join strings.
Example:
let firstName = "Susruthi"
let lastName = "Kanaparthi"
console.log(firstName + " " + lastName)

Escape Characters in JavaScript:
\b – backspace
\n – new line
\t – tab space
\ – backslash

Example:
console.log("Susruthi\nKanaparthi")

typeof Operator:
It is used to check the data type of a variable.
Example:
let a = 10
console.log(typeof a)  // Output: number

History of JavaScript

In the 1990s, the Internet became very popular. At that time, web applications were created using HTML and CSS, but they were not interactive.

In 1993, the Mosaic browser was available. Later, a company called Netscape created its own browser called Netscape Navigator. Other companies, like Microsoft, also introduced their browsers, such as Internet Explorer.

Netscape Navigator was a paid browser, while Internet Explorer was free. To compete, Netscape wanted to make its web pages interactive.

At that time, Java was a popular language, and it had Java applets for web-based interaction. So, Netscape decided to create a new lightweight scripting language for the browser. They hired **Brendan Eich**, who developed the first version of JavaScript in just **10 days**.

Initially, the language was named **Mocha**, then it was renamed to **LiveScript**, and finally, it was called **JavaScript** when it was released with Netscape Navigator 2. Around the same time, Microsoft introduced its own version called **JScript** for Internet Explorer.

So, Netscape browsers used **JavaScript**, and Internet Explorer used **JScript**.

Microsoft started gaining more users, and eventually, to standardize the language, JavaScript was submitted to **ECMA (European Computer Manufacturers Association)**. In 1997, **ECMAScript** was launched as the official standard for JavaScript.

By 1999, the World Wide Web (www) grew rapidly, and many companies started creating their own websites. However, many also shut down during the dot-com crash. Netscape was sold to AOL, and its browser was later made open source, which became the foundation for **Firefox**.

Over time, ECMAScript added more features. In **2005**, **AJAX** (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) was introduced, allowing data to be updated on web pages without refreshing — leading to the creation of **Single Page Applications (SPA)**.

In **2008**, Google introduced the **V8 Engine** in its Chrome browser, which made JavaScript run much faster.
JavaScript is an **interpreted language**, meaning code runs line by line, which made it slower compared to compiled languages. The V8 engine solved this problem by compiling JavaScript into faster machine code.

Then came **Node.js**, which used the V8 engine to run JavaScript outside the browser — allowing it to be used for both frontend and backend development.

In **2009**, **ECMAScript 5 (ES5)** was released with major improvements.
In **2015**, **ECMAScript 6 (ES6)** became a major milestone, adding many new features like `let`, `const`, arrow functions, and classes.
After that, new versions such as **ES7**, **ES8**, and so on have been released every year. The current version is **ECMAScript 12**.

JavaScript is **backward compatible**, meaning old features still work in new versions. However, it is **not forward compatible**, so new features may not work in older browsers.

JScript and ActionScript were later discontinued.
**Macromedia** (the company behind ActionScript) was acquired by **Adobe**, and **Sun Microsystems** (which was linked to Java) was acquired by **Oracle**.

Type Conversion and Type Coercion in JavaScript

JavaScript is a loosely typed or dynamically typed language. This means variables are not bound to any specific data type. JavaScript can automatically or manually convert data from one type to another.


1. Type Conversion (Explicit Conversion)


Type Conversion means converting one data type to another **manually** by using built-in functions like Number(), String(), and Boolean().

Example:
let num = "25";
let convertedNum = Number(num);
console.log(convertedNum); // 25
console.log(typeof convertedNum); // number

Common Conversion Methods:
Number()  → converts to number
String()  → converts to string
Boolean() → converts to true or false

Examples:
String(123);  // "123"
Number("45"); // 45
Boolean(0);   // false


2. Type Coercion (Implicit Conversion)


Type Coercion happens **automatically** when JavaScript needs to perform an operation between two different types. The engine converts one type to another on its own.

Example 1:
console.log("5" + 2); // "52"
Explanation: JavaScript converts 2 to a string and joins them.

Example 2:
console.log("5" - 2); // 3
Explanation: JavaScript converts "5" to a number and performs subtraction.


3. Difference between Type Conversion and Type Coercion


Type Conversion → done manually by the developer.
Type Coercion → done automatically by JavaScript.

Example of Type Conversion: Number("10")
Example of Type Coercion: "10" * 2


4. Truthy and Falsy Values


When converting values to Boolean, JavaScript treats some values as false and others as true.

Falsy values: 0, "", null, undefined, NaN, false
Truthy values: all other values like "hello", 1, [], {}

Example:
if ("") console.log("Hello"); // not printed because "" is falsy
if ("Hi") console.log("Hi");  // printed because "Hi" is truthy


Summary:
Type Conversion → Explicit, done manually using functions.
Type Coercion → Implicit, done automatically by JavaScript.
Both are ways of changing data types, but conversion gives more control, while coercion happens automatically during operations.

Operators in JavaScript

Operators are special symbols used to perform operations on values or variables.
JavaScript supports different types of operators that help manipulate data.



1. Arithmetic Operators

Used to perform basic mathematical operations.

* → Addition

- → Subtraction

* → Multiplication
  / → Division
  % → Modulus (remainder)
  ** → Exponentiation (power)
  ++ → Increment (adds 1)
  -- → Decrement (subtracts 1)

Example:
let a = 10, b = 5;
console.log(a + b); // 15
console.log(a % b); // 0


2. Assignment Operators


Used to assign values to variables.

= → Assign value
+= → Add and assign
-= → Subtract and assign
*= → Multiply and assign
/= → Divide and assign
%= → Modulus and assign

Example:
let x = 10;
x += 5;  // x = x + 5 → 15
x *= 2;  // x = x * 2 → 30


3. Comparison (Relational) Operators

Used to compare two values and return true or false.

== → Equal to (checks only value)
=== → Strict equal (checks value and type)
!= → Not equal
!== → Strict not equal

> → Greater than
> < → Less than
> = → Greater than or equal to
> <= → Less than or equal to

Example:
console.log(5 == "5");  // true
console.log(5 === "5"); // false

4. Logical Operators


Used to combine multiple conditions.

&& → Logical AND (true if all are true)
|| → Logical OR (true if one is true)
!  → Logical NOT (reverses boolean value)

Example:
let a = 10, b = 20;
console.log(a < b && b < 30); // true
console.log(!(a < b));        // false


5. String Operators


* → Used for concatenation (joining strings).

Example:
let name = "Susruthi";
console.log("Hello " + name); // Hello Susruthi


6. Ternary Operator (Conditional Operator)

Used as a shortcut for if-else.

Syntax:
condition ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse

Example:
let age = 18;
let result = age >= 18 ? "Adult" : "Minor";
console.log(result); // Adult


7. Type Operators


typeof → Returns the type of a variable
instanceof → Checks if an object is an instance of a class

Example:
console.log(typeof "Hello");  // string
console.log([1, 2, 3] instanceof Array); // true


8. Bitwise Operators


Used to perform bit-level operations.

& → AND
| → OR
^ → XOR
~ → NOT
<< → Left shift

> > → Right shift

Example:
console.log(5 & 1); // 1
console.log(5 | 1); // 5


Summary:
Arithmetic → +, -, *, /, %, ++, --
Assignment → =, +=, -=, *=, /=
Comparison → ==, ===, !=, >, <
Logical → &&, ||, !
String → +
Ternary → ? :
Type → typeof, instanceof
Bitwise → &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>



Template Literal in JavaScript

Template literals are used to work easily with strings in JavaScript.
They allow adding variables or expressions inside strings without using the plus (+) operator.
They are written using backticks (`) instead of single or double quotes.

1. Basic Example
   let name = "Susruthi"
   console.log(`Hello ${name}`)
   Output: Hello Susruthi

Here ${name} is called string interpolation, used to insert variable values into a string.

2. Multi-line Strings
   With template literals, you can write strings in multiple lines without using \n.
   Example:
   let message = `This is line 1  
   This is line 2  
   This is line 3`
   console.log(message)

3. Expression Interpolation
   You can include expressions or calculations inside ${}.
   Example:
   let a = 10
   let b = 20
   console.log(`The sum of ${a} and ${b} is ${a + b}`)
   Output: The sum of 10 and 20 is 30

4. Function Inside Template Literal
   You can call functions inside ${}.
   Example:
   function greet(name) {
   return `Welcome ${name}!`
   }
   console.log(`Message: ${greet("Susruthi")}`)

5. Nested Template Literals
   You can use one template literal inside another.
   Example:
   let user = "Susruthi"
   let role = "Developer"
   console.log(`User: ${user}, Role: ${`${role}`}`)

Summary:

* Use backticks (`) instead of quotes
* Use ${} for variables or expressions
* Supports multi-line strings
* Can include functions or calculations inside ${}
* Easier and cleaner than using + for string concatenation

Conditional Statements in JavaScript

Conditional statements are used to make decisions in a program.
They help execute different parts of code based on certain conditions (true or false).

1. if Statement
   Used to run a block of code only if a condition is true.
   Example:
   let age = 18
   if (age >= 18) {
   console.log("You are eligible to vote")
   }

2. if...else Statement
   Used when there are two outcomes – one if the condition is true, another if it is false.
   Example:
   let marks = 35
   if (marks >= 40) {
   console.log("Pass")
   } else {
   console.log("Fail")
   }

3. if...else if...else Statement
   Used to check multiple conditions one after another.
   Example:
   let score = 75
   if (score >= 90) {
   console.log("Grade A")
   } else if (score >= 70) {
   console.log("Grade B")
   } else if (score >= 50) {
   console.log("Grade C")
   } else {
   console.log("Fail")
   }

4. Nested if Statement
   Used when one if statement is written inside another if statement.
   Example:
   let username = "Susruthi"
   let password = "1234"
   if (username === "Susruthi") {
   if (password === "1234") {
   console.log("Login successful")
   } else {
   console.log("Wrong password")
   }
   }

5. switch Statement
   Used to compare one variable with multiple values.
   Example:
   let day = 3
   switch (day) {
   case 1:
   console.log("Monday")
   break
   case 2:
   console.log("Tuesday")
   break
   case 3:
   console.log("Wednesday")
   break
   default:
   console.log("Invalid day")
   }

Summary:
if → checks one condition
if...else → checks two outcomes
if...else if...else → checks multiple conditions
nested if → one if inside another
switch → compares one variable with multiple values



Looping Statements in JavaScript

Looping statements are used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a certain condition becomes false.
They help reduce code repetition and make programs more efficient.


1. for Loop


Used when you know how many times you want to run a block of code.

Syntax:
for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
// code to execute
}

Example:
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
console.log(i)
}
// Output: 1 2 3 4 5


2. while Loop


Used when you don’t know how many times to loop, but you know the condition to stop.

Syntax:
while (condition) {
// code to execute
}

Example:
let i = 1
while (i <= 5) {
console.log(i)
i++
}


3. do...while Loop


Similar to the while loop, but it runs the code at least once before checking the condition.

Syntax:
do {
// code to execute
} while (condition)

Example:
let i = 1
do {
console.log(i)
i++
} while (i <= 5)


4. for...in Loop


Used to loop through the properties of an object.

Example:
let person = { name: "Susruthi", age: 22, city: "Hyderabad" }
for (let key in person) {
console.log(key + ": " + person[key])
}


5. for...of Loop


Used to loop through iterable objects like arrays, strings, etc.

Example:
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for (let fruit of fruits) {
console.log(fruit)
}


6. break and continue


break → exits the loop completely.
continue → skips the current iteration and continues with the next one.

Example:
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
if (i === 3) continue
if (i === 5) break
console.log(i)
}
// Output: 1 2 4


Summary:
for → loop with known iterations
while → loop with condition
do...while → runs once before checking condition
for...in → loops through object properties
for...of → loops through iterable values
break → exits loop
continue → skips one iteration

Objects in JavaScript

Objects are one of the most important data types in JavaScript.
They are used to store data in the form of key-value pairs.
Each key is called a property, and it stores a value (which can be a string, number, array, function, or another object).

1. Creating an Object
   There are two common ways to create an object:

Using object literal:
let person = {
name: "Susruthi",
age: 22,
city: "Hyderabad"
}

Using new Object():
let person = new Object()
person.name = "Susruthi"
person.age = 22
person.city = "Hyderabad"

2. Accessing Object Properties
   You can access object properties in two ways:

Dot notation:
console.log(person.name)

Bracket notation:
console.log(person["age"])

3. Adding New Properties
   You can add new properties to an object even after creation.
   person.country = "India"

4. Modifying Property Values
   You can update the existing property values.
   person.age = 23

5. Deleting Properties
   You can remove a property using the delete keyword.
   delete person.city

6. Object Methods
   Objects can also contain functions as their properties.
   These are called methods.

Example:
let person = {
name: "Susruthi",
greet: function() {
console.log("Hello " + this.name)
}
}
person.greet()

7. Nested Objects
   Objects can have other objects inside them.
   Example:
   let student = {
   name: "Sita",
   address: {
   city: "Hyderabad",
   pin: 500001
   }
   }
   console.log(student.address.city)

8. Object.keys() and Object.values()
   These are built-in methods to get keys or values of an object.
   Object.keys(person) → returns all keys
   Object.values(person) → returns all values

9. for...in Loop with Objects
   Used to loop through all properties of an object.
   Example:
   for (let key in person) {
   console.log(key + ": " + person[key])
   }

Summary:

* Objects store data in key-value pairs
* Access properties using dot or bracket notation
* You can add, update, or delete properties anytime
* Functions inside objects are called methods
* Objects can be nested
* Object.keys() and Object.values() help in working with keys and values
* Use for...in loop to iterate through properties


Functions in JavaScript

A function is a block of code designed to perform a specific task.
It helps in reusing code, reducing repetition, and improving readability.
You can call (execute) a function whenever you need it.

1. Function Declaration
   A normal way to create a function.
   Syntax:
   function functionName() {
   // code to execute
   }

Example:
function greet() {
console.log("Hello, Welcome to JavaScript")
}
greet()

2. Function with Parameters
   You can pass values (called parameters) to a function.
   Example:
   function greet(name) {
   console.log("Hello " + name)
   }
   greet("Susruthi")

3. Function with Return Value
   A function can return a value using the return keyword.
   Example:
   function add(a, b) {
   return a + b
   }
   let result = add(10, 20)
   console.log(result)

4. Function Expression
   You can also store a function inside a variable.
   Example:
   let multiply = function(a, b) {
   return a * b
   }
   console.log(multiply(4, 5))

5. Arrow Function (ES6 Feature)
   A shorter way to write functions using the => symbol.
   Example:
   let greet = (name) => {
   console.log(`Hello ${name}`)
   }
   greet("Susruthi")

If there is only one statement, you can omit the curly braces and return keyword.
Example:
let square = (num) => num * num
console.log(square(5))

6. Default Parameters
   You can assign default values to parameters.
   Example:
   function display(message = "Welcome") {
   console.log(message)
   }
   display()
   display("Hello Susruthi")

7. Function Scope
   Variables declared inside a function cannot be accessed outside of it.
   Example:
   function test() {
   let x = 10
   console.log(x)
   }
   test()
   // console.log(x) → error, x is not defined

8. Nested Functions
   You can define one function inside another.
   Example:
   function outer() {
   function inner() {
   console.log("This is inner function")
   }
   inner()
   }
   outer()

9. Anonymous Functions
   Functions without a name are called anonymous functions.
   They are usually used in expressions or as arguments.
   Example:
   setTimeout(function() {
   console.log("Hello after 2 seconds")
   }, 2000)

Summary:

* Functions are reusable blocks of code
* Use parameters to pass data
* Use return to send data back
* Can be defined using function declaration or expression
* Arrow functions are short and modern
* Default parameters provide fallback values
* Variables inside functions have local scope
* Functions can be nested or anonymous



this keyword in JavaScript

The "this" keyword refers to the object that is currently executing the function.
Its value changes depending on where it is used.

1. In an object method, "this" refers to the object itself.
2. In a regular function, "this" refers to the global object (window in browser) or undefined in strict mode.
3. In an event handler, "this" refers to the HTML element that triggered the event.
4. In arrow functions, "this" does not have its own value; it uses "this" from the surrounding scope.

const person = {
  name: "Susruthi",
  showName: function() {
    console.log(this.name);
  }
};
person.showName(); // Output: Susruthi


ES6+ in JavaScript

ES6 Features Important for MEAN Stack
-------------------------------------

let and const
Used for declaring variables.
let allows reassignment and const is fixed.
They replace var and help avoid scope problems.

Arrow Functions
Used to write shorter functions.
They automatically bind this keyword, useful in callbacks and async code.
Example: const add = (a, b) => a + b;

Template Literals
Used to create strings with variables easily using backticks.
Example: Welcome ${user}

Destructuring
Used to extract data from arrays or objects easily.
Helps when working with MongoDB or API data.
Example: const { name, age } = user;

Spread and Rest Operators (...)
Spread expands arrays or objects.
Rest collects multiple arguments into an array.
Example: const arr2 = [...arr1]; and function sum(...nums) {}

Classes
Used for creating objects and writing object-oriented code.
Helpful for models, services, and controllers in Node.js and Angular.

Modules (import and export)
Used to organize code into multiple files.
Example: export const name = "Susruthi"; 
and 
import { name } from "./file.js";

Promises and Async/Await
Used for handling asynchronous operations like API calls and database queries.
Async makes code look synchronous and easier to read.

Default Parameters
Used to set default values for function parameters.
Example: function greet(name = "Guest") {}

Enhanced Object Literals
Used to simplify object creation.
Example: let user = { name, greet() { console.log("Hi " + name); } };
